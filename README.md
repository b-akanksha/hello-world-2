# 👋 Hi, I’m Akanksha!  

### 🌟 About Me  
I’m a code enthusiast who’s spent 4 years turning coffee ☕ into sleek, user-friendly web apps. With a knack for **Front-End and BFF development**, I’m on a mission to create accessible and scalable solutions that users can’t get enough of!  

When I’m not debugging code (or life), you’ll probably find me:  
- 🎶 Jamming to K-pop or Bollywood hits like it’s a concert in my room.  
- 🎬 Binge-watching K-dramas and wondering why my life isn’t this dramatic.  
- 📚 Getting lost in books and overanalyzing every plot twist.  
- 🐾 Hanging out with cats because, let’s face it, they’re the real MVPs.  

### 🛠️ Tech Skills  
- React.js, Redux, and clean, scalable code.  
- Accessibility champion because the web is for everyone.
