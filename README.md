# 👋 Hey, I’m Akanksha!  

### 🌟 About Me  
I’m a developer by day and a dreamer by night (or maybe both, depending on deadlines). With 4 years of experience in **Front-End and BFF development**, I specialize in making web apps that are not just functional but also delightful. Think of me as your friendly neighborhood code ninja, slicing bugs and delivering features like a pro. 🥷💻  

When I’m not busy writing code, you’ll find me:  
- 🎶 Turning up the volume to K-pop and Bollywood playlists (EXO SVT stans, unite!).  
- 🎬 Devouring K-dramas and pretending I don’t have a massive to-watch list.  
- 📚 Falling headfirst into books and living multiple lives through stories.  
- 🐾 Worshiping cats because let’s face it, they’re better than humans.  

I’m all about clean code, seamless user experiences. If you love innovative tech and fun conversations, we’re already a perfect match.  

### 🛠️ My Tech Stack  
- **Languages & Frameworks**: React.js, Redux, HTML5, CSS, and a pinch of JavaScript magic.  
- **Passions**: Accessibility, problem-solving, and turning crazy ideas into reality.

Let’s make something awesome together. The coffee’s on me! ☕🚀
